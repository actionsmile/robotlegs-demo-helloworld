## Hello World!
Very simple demo application, built with [Robotlegs 2](https://github.com/robotlegs/robotlegs-framework).
In this example you'll see how simple and flexible can be app development. I tried to comment each step, so hope there are no whitespaces of basic RL2 usage.

## Build
Project contains `ant` script, which will compile debug application using **mxmlc**. All you need is to set `FLEX_HOME` variable in your environment and launch

	ant build
